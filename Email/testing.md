# Testing Emails

Testing emails in Magento can be a bit of a pain. Here's what I've come up with:

##Testing New Orders emails

Most of the time when you test a new order email template, it will be in the development environment (we don't want to purchase anything from our 
clients sites on accident -- do we?). The easiest way that I can find to do this is by doing the following:

1. Create a new order with the Magento Admin:
    1. Go to the orders menu at `Sales > Orders`
    2. Click "Create New Order" in the top right
    3. Follow the process for generating a new order, it's rather straightforward
2. Send an email:
    1. Go to the orders menu at `Sales > Orders`
    2. Click on the order you just created
    3. In the top right, there will be a "Send Email" button, click it.
3. Waitâ€¦

I've found this to be the most expeditious method of testing, as it is the most replicable and avoid the hassle of the checkout process on the frontend.
