#A cookbook for Magento
##Because I can't find sufficient documentation in one place##

I'll be putting all of my recipes in here. Given the amount of Magento work I do, this could get rather large over time.


###TODO: 

- Write some more about editing layouts with local.xml
- Cover the hierarchy of themes
- Begin documenting how the Magneto API works (I may go stir crazy in the process, stay tuned)
- Investigate why Magento email templates will only use base theme files (as opposed to your own).
- Let's be honest, there's so much to do...

### Of Course...

If you would like me to add anything, file an issue report and I'll probably end up doing it.
