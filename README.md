#A cookbook for Magento
##Because I can't find sufficient documentation in one place##

I'll be putting all of my recipes in here. Given the amount of Magento work I do, this could get rather large over time.


###TODO: 

- Write some more about editing layouts with local.xml
- Begin documenting how the Magneto API works (I may go stir crazy in the process, stay tuned)
