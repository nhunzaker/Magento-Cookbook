# Layouts

## The cardinal rule: Use local.xml, always

Every element that has been configured in a [layout].xml file can be edited within a special layout xml document called "local.xml". 
Simply place this file within the "layouts" folder of your magento theme and start writing some XML (Please try not to vomit in the process).
