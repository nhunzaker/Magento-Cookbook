# Checkout Recipes

## The mini cart (In the header on enterprise edition)

* Note: This is also known as the cart summary *

### Configure Settings

** You want to: **

1. Edit the number of items which display in the cart summary
2. Disable/Enable the cart

Both settings can be configured with in the Magento admin at the following location:

`System > Configuration > Checkout (Under Sales Sidebar) > Shopping Cart Sidebar`

This is called the sidebar because it will also display on the cart page. Why they don't clarify, I have no idea.
