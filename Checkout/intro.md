# Checkout Recipes

## The Cart Summary/Mini-Cart (In the header on Enterprise Edition)

### Configure Settings

#### You want to: 

1. Edit the number of items which display in the cart summary
2. Disable/Enable the cart

#### The solution:
Both settings can be configured with in the Magento admin at the following location:

`System > Configuration > Checkout (Under Sales Sidebar) > Shopping Cart Sidebar`

This is called the sidebar because it will also display on the cart page. Why they don't clarify, I have no idea.
